Project Ideation!
What is the project about.
	Data is one of the most impacting thing of a business and if we can analyze the data then we can get meaningful and important insights from it which can lead to business progress. 
	So how to analyze data? While using fast but not so structured databases like mongo DB it is easy to store any kind of data but it is really taught to understand data for a person. Its simple we couldn’t analyze data in BSON or even in JSON format.
	As we know visual representation of data is much better to understand the flow of data so using some visualization tool we can analyze it.
	And here we got our idea to create Dashboard using a visualization tool for a mongo DB database. So tried to combine our visualization and data skills on a existing data to fetch an existing data and analyze it. 
So basically this Project is all about Data Analysis of book’s data.


What is the end goal of this project.
	We created a Tableau and Power BI dashboard  so we can fetched data to get insights from it.  And try to understand the flow of data and solve some business cases of that using our visuals.
	 Our main goal is to allow people to solve there own problem cases using data.


What are the target audience of this project.
	We have taken books data so the measure audience our project is book author’s. 
	Book publication houses, book readers and reviewers, book selling shops and online book blogging sites as well as our project can be useful for events and award firms to check public ratings for a book and author.


Front End
	As a front end technology we have taken one of the popular tools Tableau and Power BI for creating beautiful visuals.


Back End
	In terms of backend technology we used some python for data cleaning and data loading. To connect data base with Tableau we used ODBC driver of mongo DB.


Data Base
	As a database we used mongo DB in which we imported our collected data using python. 


This dashboard consists of clustered column chart which represents the
Total cost , Profit and quantity of Month
It also consists of different cards which represent profit margin , Total cost, quantity ,Average Of Sales, Profit , Price Per Page, Max Of Sales , Latest publication Date, Price Per page.
